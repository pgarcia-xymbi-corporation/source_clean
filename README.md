C Analyzer/Cleaner
=============

This script analyzes C source files to check for strings specified and remove duplicates from all files/folders specified.

Usage
-----

```shell
chmod +x source_clean.pl
./source_clean.pl /dir/to/clean/ string-to-clean
```

Disclaimer
----------

It is extremely complicated to fully analyze and clean a/multiple source file(s) automatically. Using this script does not mean you don't have to analyze the source code yourself. Use at your own risk.
